Force Plate case study
Strength and conditioning plays a key role in the health, performance, 
and development of collegiate women’s soccer. Utilizing key technology to 
help implement strength and conditioning training programs is an essential 
skill of a performance and sport science practitioner. 
Using the Soccer Force Plate data set, please profile the team’s 
lower body power and work to complete the following case study:

The task is to create a lower body power profile for the women’s soccer team 
using data from countermovement jumps. 

First, using the data set, select 
key metrics that help to describe lower body power production, throughout 
the phases of a countermovement jump. 

The strength and conditioning coach would like to understand everyone’s lower body power capabilities, understand 
how individuals compare within their position group, and receive basic 
recommendations for development based on their profiles.

As a finished product you will include visualizations/a presentation 
of your lower body power profile for each individual by position group and 
discuss your process through the following key areas:

•	What metrics you chose and why you chose them

•	Methods used to analyze the countermovement jump data and compare within 
  position groups (be prepared to take us from raw data through your final output)
  
•	Exercise recommendations based on 2-4 common deficits within 
  the profiles (strength or plyometric)
